# twoc

## About twoc
twoc is a programming language for [two-way one-counter automata](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/193820.193835). Any program in twoc can be represented by an equivalent two-way one-counter automaton, and vice versa (I haven't properly proven this yet, but I will at some point).

## Usage
1. Make sure that you have Rust installed on your machine with the Cargo build manager
2. Type ```cargo run [name of the program] [input string]``` into the terminal to run a twoc program on a specified input
